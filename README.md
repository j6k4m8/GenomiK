# Computational Genomics

### Installing/Running on UGRAD Machines
1) Follow `README-GO.md` and `README-Meteor-Node.md` (in that order). This will give you local `go` and `meteor` installs and give you a clone of our repo in your GOPATH (specifically `$GOPATH/src/github/j6k4m8/cg`).
2) While in `$GOPATH/src/github/j6k4m8/cg/genomik`, run:
```
meteor
```
Please note that the first run will take some time.

### Code locations
All backend code (written in go) is located in the `cgg` folder.

All frontend code (written in javascript/node) is located in the `genomik` folder.
